          <p>As of 2021, the gaming industry is now larger than that of both music and TV combined, which is to say that a lot of people play games, 26% of the world's population to be precise. Therefore, it should be concerning that <span style="color:#1d9700;">of adults who play games online, 74% reported experiencing some form of harassment while playing.</span> Additionally, 65% of these players have experienced more severe harassment, including stalking, threats of violence, and sustained harassment. These shocking statistics beg the question: where does toxicity in online games come from, and why is it so persistent in gaming culture today?</p>

          <p>Not all players are equally likely to exhibit toxic behavior. Besides the unsurprising fact that traits like sadism and psychopathy correlate highest with toxicity, the profile of someone most likely to act out negatively tells us a lot about the causes of such behavior, and raises pertinent questions. For one, introverts and lonely people who were categorized as "identity-fused," defined as showing extreme attachment to an abstraction, were the players most likely to be toxic in-game. These outbursts frequently manifest in a defensive way, and, though originating from a sense of community and pride, can be negative and harassing in nature. <span style="color:#f4c238;">These are people who frequently turn to online games as a substitute for offline interaction, so it makes sense that they are vocal about perceived threats to their community.</span> But what are these threats? Are they real, or imaginary? Why do these gamers feel this way?</p>

      <div class="modal center-content" id="modal3">

          <img class="center-content" src="head0.jpg"></img>
          <p>Online game spaces can have an incredible influence on people. <span style="color:#84e5f8;">They are conducive to fostering both love and hate, but above all, community.</span> The results of a study conducted on identity-fused players who played either the competitive shooter <i>Call of Duty</i> or the cooperative building game <i>Minecraft</i> found that the former gamers showed a higher correlation between fusion and antisocial interactions than the latter. The researchers concluded that “fusion with gaming culture is associated with social toxicity and social positivity differently depending on the gaming environment.” These differing cultures showcase the double-edged nature of the effect game spaces can have on players.</p>

          <p>The self reinforcing nature of the relationship between players and game spaces in relation to online toxicity creates a difficult chicken-and-egg scenario: <span style="color:#ff331f;">do toxic players create toxic gaming spaces, or does the conduciveness of game environments to creating toxic behavior create toxic players?</span> Results are currently inconclusive, but for now, it is likely the case that both play at least some part in the creation and persistence of toxicity in online gaming. Therefore,  it is important to examine the role of both variables in regard to this issue, as each contributor reinforces the influence of the other, and neither is without real-world context.</p>
